In case you come across any errors in your program it mainly occurs due to the following reasons:

1.Not having pygame installed.
2.Syntax error (You have written the code wrong)
3.Very old version of python.
4.etc.

Coming across errors is really frustrating but if you take your time and read the code you've written a several times you will come across what you have made wrong.
