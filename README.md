In case you come across any errors in your program it mainly occurs due to the following reasons:

-Not having pygame installed.
-Syntax error (You have written the code wrong)
-Very old version of python.
-etc.

Coming across errors is really frustrating but if you take your time and read the code you've written a several times you will come across what you have made wrong.
